Now that the initial setup is complete, let's implement the screenshot management system for GameSage.

**Requirements:**

1. Configurable capture intervals.
2. Support for multiple monitors.
3. Manual capture via hotkeys.
4. Image processing and compression pipeline.
5. Basic scene change detection.

For Phase 2, please provide:

- Component architecture for the screenshot service.
- Code examples for capturing and storing screenshots.
- Explanation of image compression strategies and scene detection algorithms.
- Integration points with the main Electron process.
- Testing strategies (mocking screenshot operations).

After this, I'll move on to AI integration in Phase 3.
