With screenshot management in place, let's integrate the OpenAI Vision API and our prompt management system.

**Requirements:**

1. OpenAI Vision API integration.
2. Prompt templates for Tactical, Commentary, and E-Sports Cast modes.
3. Response parsing and handling.
4. Context management and short-term memory.
5. Error handling and fallback strategies.

For Phase 3, please provide:

- Architectural diagram of AI integration flow.
- Example code for calling the OpenAI Vision API.
- Prompt template structures and handling logic.
- State management with Redux Toolkit for AI responses.
- Testing approaches for API calls (e.g., using axios mocks).

After this, we will address game profiles in Phase 4.
