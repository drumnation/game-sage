Please help me conduct a development phase audit. Here's what I'd like you to do:

First, analyze the current codebase and list:

- All implemented features and their current status
- Any features still in progress
- Features planned but not yet started

For each implemented feature:

- Review the component structure according to our cursor rules
- Check if all required files exist (.tsx, .types.ts, .styles.ts, .hook.ts, etc.)
- Verify test coverage (unit tests, integration tests)
- Identify any missing tests or incomplete implementations

Create a summary report that includes:

- Completed features with full test coverage
- Features needing additional tests
- Features requiring structural improvements
- A prioritized list of remaining tasks

Please start by examining the instructions I'm about to share.

Don't start coding right away.
