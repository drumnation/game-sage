I am building "GameSage", an AI-powered gaming assistant using Electron, React, TypeScript, and OpenAI's Vision API. The tool periodically captures screenshots of a user’s game and provides insights like tactical advice, commentary, and e-sports style casting based on a selectable mode. It supports voice interaction, custom hotkeys, and user-defined game profiles.

We will develop the application in phases as outlined below. You will act as a senior software architect, guiding me through each phase with detailed technical specs, code examples, testing strategies, and best practices. After completing each phase, I will prompt you with the next phase’s instructions.

**Start with Phase 1: Project Setup and Basic Architecture.**

**Phase 1 Requirements:**

1. Create the initial Electron + React + TypeScript project structure.
2. Integrate Redux Toolkit, Styled Components, and Ant Design.
3. Configure basic main and renderer processes.
4. Implement a simple frontend scaffold with a start screen.
5. Show how to use a minimal generator or template for Electron to expedite setup.
6. Include testing setup (e.g., Jest) for basic smoke tests.

For Phase 1, please provide:

- Detailed project structure and file layout.
- Code examples for the main and renderer initialization.
- Configuration details (tsconfig, package.json, etc.).
- Initial UI scaffold code snippet.
- Testing approach and sample tests.

After receiving your response, I will provide the prompt for Phase 2.
