Now that AI integration is in place, let's implement the game profiles system.

**Requirements:**

1. Profile creation and switching.
2. Game-specific configurations (item names, power-ups, recommended strategies).
3. Custom prompt templates per profile.
4. Simple performance tracking per game.
5. Local storage persistence.

For Phase 4, please provide:

- Data model and schema for profiles.
- Code examples for loading/saving profiles.
- Integration with Redux state.
- Approach for migrating profiles between versions.
- Testing strategies for profile switching logic.

Next, we will tackle UI/UX improvements in Phase 5.
